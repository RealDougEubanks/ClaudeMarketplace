# adr

## Purpose

Create, list, update, and supersede Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) following the Markdown Architectural Decision Records (MADR) format. Maintains a `docs/decisions/` directory. Works standalone or as a companion to `/architecture-design`.

---

## ADR Format (MADR)

Every ADR uses this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: <Title>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-NNN
**Deciders:** <names or roles>
**Tags:** <architecture | security | database | api | infrastructure | ...>

## Context and Problem Statement

[1-3 paragraphs: what situation led to this decision? What is the problem being solved? What forces are at play?]

## Decision Drivers

- [driver 1: most important constraint or goal]
- [driver 2]

## Considered Options

1. **[Option A — Recommended]** — one-sentence description
2. **[Option B]** — one-sentence description
3. **[Option C]** — one-sentence description

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** [Option A], because [one paragraph justification tied to decision drivers].

### Positive Consequences
- [what becomes easier, better, or possible]

### Negative Consequences / Trade-offs
- [what becomes harder, more expensive, or is given up]

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option A — [Name]
- ✅ [pro]
- ✅ [pro]
- ❌ [con]
- ❌ [con]

### Option B — [Name]
- ✅ [pro]
- ❌ [con]

## Links
- [Link to related ADR, design doc, RFC, or Jira ticket]
```

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Determine the action

Ask the user what they want to do:
- **(a) Create a new ADR** — document a new architectural decision
- **(b) List existing ADRs** — show all ADRs with status and one-line summary
- **(c) Update an ADR's status** — mark as Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **(d) Supersede an ADR** — create a new ADR that replaces an existing one
- **(e) Search ADRs** — find ADRs by tag, status, or keyword

---

### Step 2a — Create a new ADR

1. Use Glob to find all existing ADRs in `docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`. Determine the next number.
2. Use Read on any related existing ADRs mentioned.
3. Ask the user:
   - What is the decision being made? (one sentence title)
   - What is the context / problem? (what forced this decision)
   - Who are the deciders?
   - What options were considered?
   - What was chosen and why?
4. Generate the full ADR using the MADR format above.
5. Use Write to save to `docs/decisions/ADR-<NNN>-<kebab-case-title>.md`. Create `docs/decisions/` if it doesn't exist.
6. Update the ADR index (see Step 3).

---

### Step 2b — List existing ADRs

Use Glob to find all `docs/decisions/ADR-*.md`. Use Read on each to extract: number, title, status, date, tags. Output a sorted table:

```
## Architecture Decision Records

| # | Title | Status | Date | Tags |
|---|-------|--------|------|------|
| ADR-001 | Use PostgreSQL as primary database | Accepted | 2026-01-15 | database |
| ADR-002 | Adopt hexagonal architecture | Accepted | 2026-01-20 | architecture |
| ADR-003 | Use Redis for session storage | Proposed | 2026-02-01 | infrastructure |
```

---

### Step 2c — Update status

Use Read to load the ADR. Use Edit to update the Status field. Valid transitions:
- Proposed → Accepted (decision confirmed)
- Proposed → Deprecated (no longer relevant before being accepted)
- Accepted → Deprecated (no longer the right approach)
- Accepted → Superseded by ADR-NNN (replaced by a newer decision)

---

### Step 2d — Supersede

1. Create a new ADR (Step 2a) that documents the new decision.
2. In the new ADR, add a link: "Supersedes ADR-NNN: [title]"
3. Use Edit to update the old ADR's status to "Superseded by ADR-NNN".

---

### Step 2e — Search

Use Grep across `docs/decisions/` for the keyword or tag. Return matching ADRs with context.

---

### Step 3 — Maintain ADR Index

After any create/update operation, regenerate `docs/decisions/README.md` — an index of all ADRs sorted by number, showing status with colour-coded emoji: ✅ Accepted, 🔄 Proposed, ⚠️ Deprecated, 🔁 Superseded.

# pre-commit

Invoked via `/pre-commit`. This skill acts as a pre-commit quality gate — it runs a fast subset of checks before committing and blocks the commit if critical issues are found. It can also install itself as a git hook.

---

## Mode A — Run checks now (default)

When invoked without arguments, run immediately against staged files (or all modified files if nothing is staged):

1. Use Bash to get the list of files to check:
   ```bash
   git diff --cached --name-only 2>/dev/null || git diff --name-only
   ```

2. **Secret scan** — Use Grep across all staged files for hardcoded secret patterns:
   - Assignments (`=` or `:` — covers code, YAML, and JSON): `(?i)(password|passwd|pwd|api_key|apikey|api_token|access_token|secret_key|client_secret|secret)\s*[=:]\s*['"][^'"]{8,}['"]`
   - Shell exports: `export\s+[A-Z_]*(KEY|TOKEN|SECRET|PASSWORD)[A-Z_]*=\S{8,}`
   - AWS: `(?i)(aws_access_key_id|aws_secret_access_key)\s*[=:]\s*['"][^'"]{16,}['"]` and literal `AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}`
   - Modern token prefixes: `sk-ant-`, `sk-proj-`, `github_pat_`, `ghp_`, `xox[baprs]-`, `sk_live_`
   - Private key headers: `-----BEGIN (RSA|DSA|EC|OPENSSH) PRIVATE KEY-----`
   - High-entropy heuristic: any assignment of a 32+ char mixed-case alphanumeric literal to a variable whose name contains `key`, `token`, `secret`, or `auth`
   - Exclude: `*.example`, `*.sample`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `node_modules/`, `vendor/`
   - **BLOCKER if found.** Report file and line number. Do not commit. When reporting, redact the matched value (show the first 4 characters only).

3. **Dead code scan** — Use Grep across staged source files for:
   - `^\s*//.*` blocks of 3+ consecutive commented-out code lines (not doc comments)
   - Common placeholder strings: `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX`, `impl later`, `stub`, `placeholder`
   - Exclude: `*.md`, `*.txt`, documentation files
   - **WARNING** (non-blocking) for TODO/FIXME; **BLOCKER** for stub/placeholder in non-test files.

4. **Naming check** — Use Read on each staged source file. Load naming conventions from `CLAUDE.md` if present (Grep for "naming" section). Apply:
   - Flag obvious violations: ALL_CAPS variable names outside constants, single-letter variables outside loop counters, names < 3 chars in function signatures
   - **WARNING** (non-blocking).

5. **No direct main check** — Use Bash to confirm the current branch is NOT `main`:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```
   If on `main`, **BLOCKER**: "You are committing directly to main. Create a branch first."

6. **Trailing whitespace / merge conflicts** — Use Grep across staged files for:
   - `<<<<<<< HEAD` — unfixed merge conflict marker → **BLOCKER**
   - Trailing whitespace on lines → **WARNING**

7. **Report results** — Print a summary table:
   ```
   Pre-Commit Gate Results
   ──────────────────────
   ✓ Secret scan       PASSED
   ✗ Dead code         BLOCKED — src/foo/handler.ts:42: "stub"
   ⚠ Naming            WARNING — 2 issues (non-blocking)
   ✓ Branch check      PASSED (branch: feature/my-feature)
   ✓ Conflict markers  PASSED

   Status: BLOCKED — fix 1 blocker before committing.
   ```

8. If any BLOCKER exists: exit with a non-zero message and do NOT proceed with the commit.
   If only WARNINGs: inform the user and ask "Proceed with commit anyway? (y/n)"
   If all PASSED: confirm "All checks passed. Safe to commit."

## Mode B — Install as git hook

When invoked as `/pre-commit install`:

1. Use Bash to confirm `.git/` exists in the current working directory.
2. Check whether `.git/hooks/pre-commit` already exists. If it does, do NOT silently overwrite: copy it to `.git/hooks/pre-commit.backup`, tell the user a hook already existed and where the backup is, and ask whether they want to merge the two manually afterward.
3. Use Write to create `.git/hooks/pre-commit` with the canonical script below **verbatim** — do not regenerate, paraphrase, or "improve" it. The deterministic checks are the enforcement path; the optional Claude call is advisory only and can never block or approve a commit.

   ```bash
   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   # pre-commit hook installed by the pre-commit skill.
   # Enforcement is deterministic (grep-based). Claude, if present, is advisory only.
   # Bypass once: SKIP_PRE_COMMIT=1 git commit ...
   # (git commit --no-verify also works but skips ALL hooks, including this secret scan.)
   set -euo pipefail

   if [ -n "${SKIP_PRE_COMMIT:-}" ]; then
     exit 0
   fi

   STAGED=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM || true)
   if [ -z "$STAGED" ]; then
     exit 0
   fi

   FAIL=0

   # 1. Block direct commits to main/master
   BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   if [ "$BRANCH" = "main" ] || [ "$BRANCH" = "master" ]; then
     echo "BLOCKED: committing directly to $BRANCH. Create a branch first." >&2
     FAIL=1
   fi

   # 2. Secret scan on staged content (redacts matches in output)
   SECRET_RE='-----BEGIN (RSA|DSA|EC|OPENSSH) PRIVATE KEY-----|AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}|sk-ant-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}|sk-proj-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}|github_pat_[A-Za-z0-9_]{20,}|ghp_[A-Za-z0-9]{30,}|xox[baprs]-[A-Za-z0-9-]{10,}|sk_live_[A-Za-z0-9]{16,}'
   ASSIGN_RE="(password|passwd|pwd|api_key|apikey|api_token|access_token|secret_key|client_secret|aws_secret_access_key)[[:space:]]*[=:][[:space:]]*['\"][^'\"]{8,}['\"]|export[[:space:]]+[A-Z_]*(KEY|TOKEN|SECRET|PASSWORD)[A-Z_]*=[^[:space:]]{8,}"

   while IFS= read -r f; do
     case "$f" in
       *.example|*.sample|*.test.*|*.spec.*|node_modules/*|vendor/*) continue ;;
     esac
     MATCHES=$(git show ":$f" 2>/dev/null | grep -Ec -e "$SECRET_RE" || true)
     ASSIGNS=$(git show ":$f" 2>/dev/null | grep -icE -e "$ASSIGN_RE" || true)
     if [ "${MATCHES:-0}" -gt 0 ] || [ "${ASSIGNS:-0}" -gt 0 ]; then
       echo "BLOCKED: possible secret in staged file: $f (matches redacted — inspect the file)" >&2
       FAIL=1
     fi
   done <<< "$STAGED"

   # 3. Merge conflict markers
   while IFS= read -r f; do
     if git show ":$f" 2>/dev/null | grep -qE '^(<<<<<<< |>>>>>>> )'; then
       echo "BLOCKED: merge conflict markers in staged file: $f" >&2
       FAIL=1
     fi
   done <<< "$STAGED"

   if [ "$FAIL" -ne 0 ]; then
     echo "" >&2
     echo "pre-commit: commit blocked by deterministic checks above." >&2
     echo "Bypass once: SKIP_PRE_COMMIT=1 git commit ..." >&2
     exit 1
   fi

   # 4. Optional advisory review — output is informational only and never gates.
   #    PRE_COMMIT_ADVISORY guards against recursion (claude may run git commands).
   if [ -z "${PRE_COMMIT_ADVISORY:-}" ] && command -v claude >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     if command -v timeout >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       PRE_COMMIT_ADVISORY=1 SKIP_PRE_COMMIT=1 timeout 60 claude -p "/pre-commit" 2>/dev/null || true
     else
       PRE_COMMIT_ADVISORY=1 SKIP_PRE_COMMIT=1 claude -p "/pre-commit" 2>/dev/null || true
     fi
     echo "pre-commit: advisory review done (warnings above, if any, are non-blocking)."
   fi

   exit 0
   ```

4. Use Bash to make the hook executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
5. Confirm installation. Remind the user:
   - The hook runs locally only — team members must run `/pre-commit install` themselves (or add it to project setup scripts).
   - Skip once with `SKIP_PRE_COMMIT=1 git commit ...`.
   - `git commit --no-verify` also bypasses it, but that skips ALL hooks including the secret scan — prefer `SKIP_PRE_COMMIT=1`.
   - The Claude advisory step is optional, capped at 60 seconds where `timeout` exists, and can only warn — the deterministic checks are what block.

## Mode C — Uninstall hook

When invoked as `/pre-commit uninstall`:
1. Use Bash to check if `.git/hooks/pre-commit` exists.
2. Remove it with Bash.
3. Confirm removal.

# api-design

## Purpose

Two modes:
- **Design mode** (`/api-design`): Design a new API surface from requirements — resource modeling, endpoint naming, request/response schemas, versioning, auth, error contracts, pagination.
- **Review mode** (`/api-design --review`): Audit an existing API for consistency, best practices violations, and breaking change risks.

---

## DESIGN MODE Instructions

### Step 1 — Gather inputs

Ask the user:
- What does this API do? (domain / resource description)
- Who are the consumers? (web frontend, mobile app, third-party, internal service)
- What protocol? REST, GraphQL, gRPC, or WebSocket (or combination)
- What auth mechanism? (JWT Bearer, API Key, OAuth2, mTLS)
- Any existing APIs this must be consistent with?

Read any existing API files: `openapi.yml`, `schema.graphql`, `*.proto`, Swagger docs.

---

### Step 2 — Resource Modeling (REST)

Identify the core resources from the domain description. For each resource:
- Name it as a plural noun: `/users`, `/orders`, `/products`
- Define its fields (name, type, required/optional, description)
- Define its relationships (belongs_to, has_many)
- Map CRUD to HTTP methods:

| Operation | Method | Path | Notes |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| List | GET | /resources | Supports filtering, sorting, pagination |
| Get one | GET | /resources/:id | 404 if not found |
| Create | POST | /resources | 201 + Location header on success |
| Update (full) | PUT | /resources/:id | Idempotent |
| Update (partial) | PATCH | /resources/:id | Only send changed fields |
| Delete | DELETE | /resources/:id | 204 No Content on success |

Sub-resources: use `/resources/:id/sub-resources` only one level deep. Deeper nesting — use query params instead.

---

### Step 3 — Request / Response Design

For each endpoint define:
- Request: path params, query params (with types and validation), request body schema
- Response: success schema, all possible error codes and their meaning
- Side effects: what else changes when this endpoint is called

---

### Step 4 — Cross-Cutting Design

**Versioning strategy** — choose one and apply consistently:
- URL path: `/v1/resources` (most visible, easiest to route)
- Header: `Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=1` (cleaner URLs)
- Query param: `?version=1` (easy to test, less clean)

Recommend URL versioning for public APIs, header versioning for internal.

**Pagination** — choose one:
- Cursor-based: `{ data: [...], nextCursor: "abc123" }` — best for real-time data
- Offset-based: `{ data: [...], total: 100, limit: 20, offset: 40 }` — best for paginated UI

Document the chosen approach in the spec.

**Error response format** — standardize on one format for ALL errors:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Human-readable description",
    "details": [{ "field": "email", "message": "Invalid email format" }],
    "requestId": "abc-123"
  }
}
```

**Standard HTTP status codes to use:**
- 200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content
- 400 Bad Request (validation), 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 409 Conflict, 422 Unprocessable Entity, 429 Too Many Requests
- 500 Internal Server Error (never expose internal details in the response body)

**Rate limiting headers:** `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`

---

### Step 5 — Generate OpenAPI Spec (REST) or Schema (GraphQL/gRPC)

For REST: produce a valid OpenAPI 3.1 YAML spec covering all endpoints, request/response schemas, auth security schemes, and error responses.

For GraphQL: produce a `schema.graphql` with types, queries, mutations, subscriptions, and input types. Include field descriptions.

For gRPC: produce a `.proto` file with service definitions, message types, and comments.

---

### Step 6 — Save

Use Write to save to:
- REST: `docs/api/openapi.yml`
- GraphQL: `docs/api/schema.graphql`
- gRPC: `docs/api/<service>.proto`

---

## REVIEW MODE Instructions (`/api-design --review`)

### Step 1 — Discover existing API definitions

Use Glob to find: `openapi.yml`, `openapi.yaml`, `swagger.yml`, `schema.graphql`, `*.proto`, route files (`routes/**`, `*router*`, `*controller*`).

---

### Step 2 — Check REST best practices

- [ ] Resource names are plural nouns (not verbs: `/getUser` should be `/users/:id`)
- [ ] HTTP methods used correctly (GET is safe/idempotent, POST for creation, PATCH for partial update)
- [ ] Consistent naming: snake_case or camelCase in JSON (not mixed)
- [ ] Versioning strategy present and consistent
- [ ] Pagination implemented on all list endpoints
- [ ] Standardized error response format across all endpoints
- [ ] 401 vs 403 used correctly (not authenticated vs not authorized)
- [ ] No sensitive data in URL paths or query params (tokens, passwords)
- [ ] Request bodies validated with schema
- [ ] Response includes only necessary fields (not leaking internal IDs, passwords, internal state)
- [ ] Idempotency keys for non-idempotent POST operations (payments, sends)
- [ ] HATEOAS or at minimum consistent linking strategy for related resources

---

### Step 3 — Check GraphQL best practices

- [ ] Types and fields have descriptions
- [ ] Mutations return the mutated type (not just boolean)
- [ ] Errors returned via `errors` array, not HTTP 4xx/5xx (GraphQL convention)
- [ ] N+1 query problem addressed (DataLoader or equivalent)
- [ ] Introspection disabled in production
- [ ] Query depth limiting configured
- [ ] Pagination uses Connection pattern (Relay spec: edges/nodes/pageInfo)
- [ ] Input types used for mutation arguments (not inline scalars)

---

### Step 4 — Check for Breaking Changes

Flag any changes that would break existing consumers:
- Removing a field or endpoint
- Changing a field type
- Making an optional field required
- Changing HTTP method or path
- Changing error response format

---

### Step 5 — Output review report

Format findings by severity:

**CRITICAL** — breaking changes or security issues (e.g., sensitive data exposed in URLs, no auth on write endpoints)
**HIGH** — significant consistency or contract violations
**MEDIUM** — best practice deviations that will cause friction
**LOW** — minor naming inconsistencies or missing documentation

For each finding include:
- Severity
- Location (endpoint, field, file)
- Issue description
- Recommended fix (with diff if applicable)
- OWASP mapping where relevant (e.g., OWASP API Security Top 10)
